Ming is a first-year Ph.D student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). His research interests primarily focus on **compilers**. Previously, he worked on a series of projects on LLMs for traditional compiler construction, and his current main research interest is quantum compilers. My detailed resume can be found <a href="files/resume_Ming.pdf"> here.

# üíª Working Experience

   - **Clarification**: I was supposed to begin my Ph.D. studies at The University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Fall 2024. However, due to the [High-Risk University List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043), I did not receive a student visa in time and was unable to enroll. Consequently, I continued as a research assistant at Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), until I decided to pursue my Ph.D. degree in Hong Kong.
   *I am deeply grateful to Professors Xiaobing Feng and Fang Lv at ICT for their support during this anxious gap period, and I sincerely regret not being able to pursue my studies at UNSW.*

   - **Some Reflections**: People often say that a speck of dust in the era, when it falls on an individual, becomes a mountain. But I believe that **_sometimes a small but firm conviction can carry one a very long way, even across that mountain_**. So, please accept what can not be changed and strive to change what can be changed. Even these bleak and trying days will eventually become a valuable asset in one's life.
